Images further postponed until my friend provides them; turned to Wikimedia for free to use images. Filter functionality added. My apologies for the pages lacking the preferred amount of images. There is a landing page with a functional search bar, a suggestion page with a semi functional form, and four review pages, identical in all ways aside from name. Only the cards against humanity pages have images, as they are the only ones to have wikimedia images available. Alt text is provided where images would be in the final product.
